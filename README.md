# World_Happiness_Index Data Analysis And Visualization Task
## Summary :
For This Data Analysis Task. We Were Provided With Datasets Of Six Years From(2015-2020) Of World Happiness Index Data and Our Task Is To Clean & Analyze These Datasets and Then Visualize By Making A Dashboard In Python Using Plotly Dash To Find Meaningful Insights From This Data.
So Before Visualizing These Datasets It Needs To Be Cleaned First. First I cleaned All the Individual Datasets Of Each Year From 2015-2020 And Then Merged All The Cleaned Daasets
To One Final Dataset. I Have Also Created Some Additional Columns Based On The Given Data That Can Help In Deriving Useful Insights From These Datasets And Then Export The Final Dataset Into a CSV File And Then Use A Separate Notebook To Visualize The Data (As The Size Of Notebook Is Quite Large).
